# -Python-Keyword-Implementation---Manzano
This project is a typing shooting game where the player needs to type Python keywords that appear on the screen to shoot them down. The game helps demonstrate the understanding of Python keywords by utilizing them as part of the gameplay. Additionally, as the game progresses, the playerâ€™s typing speed is boosted to increase the challenge.

Game Overview
In this game, the player controls a shooter at the bottom of the screen, and various Python keywords will randomly appear from the top. The player must type the correct keyword as fast as possible to shoot it down. If the player misses 3 times, the game ends.

As the game progresses, the typing speed of the player is automatically boosted. This encourages the player to type faster and adds increasing difficulty. The goal is to see how long you can keep up with the fast-falling Python keywords while typing as quickly as possible.
